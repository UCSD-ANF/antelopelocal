Software in this directory is third party software required to build components of the Antelope contributed software archive. Because contrib is installed into the $ANTELOPE tree, these dependent packages are also installed in the $ANTELOPE tree to avoid a circular dependencies between $ANTELOPE and $ANF.

Some contrib dependencies are also handled by OpenCSW.org software packages installed in /opt/csw on Solaris. RRDTool is a special case, notably due to it's perl binding RRDs.pm which is used by several contrib utilities. Because RRDs.pm cannot be compiled separately from the rest of RRDTool (it uses a number of private interfaces not available to most software packages), we must compile RRDTool for use with Antelope's perl distribution.

The following programs in contrib require external dependencies:

PERL:
bin/export/db2eids:
XML::LibXML
XML::LibXSLT

bin/export/dbrecenteqs:
Image::Magick
XML::LibXML
XML::LibXSLT
XML::Writer

bin/rt/orb2rrd:
RRDs (which requires full build of RRDTool per above)

Perl module special build instructions:
PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES:
CSWlibxslt-devel
CSWlibxslt
CSWlibxml2-devel
CSWlibxml2
    
XML::libxml and XML::libxslt must be compiled by hand due to their dependencies
on the CSW packages.

Additional Perl Requirements
ANF web site requires JSON module, this can be done via CPAN or placed in $ANF tree somewhere.
